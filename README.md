## Getting Started

Welcome to the Pieces Sublime Plugin.
The Pieces Sublime plugin is designed to manage your saved materials in Pieces right from within Sublime, and interact seamlessly with Pieces OS.

To get started, check the settings. If you wish to change the llm model you're using or the host, you can do so in the settings `Preferences > Package Settings > Pieces > Settings`.

### Open Saved Material

To open your saved materials, simply open your command palette and run `Pieces: Open Saved Material`. Then, select the asset you wish to open.

#### Edit Saved Materials

To edit a saved material, you'll need to toggle into editor mode. You can do so by tapping `command/ctrl+e`. From there, you will be able to modify the contents of your material and save the changes using `command/ctrl + s`.

#### Copy Saved Material

If you're viewing a saved material, you can quickly copy the asset content without selecting it using `command/ctrl + c`.

### Right click to add an asset

To save a new snippet in Pieces, select the code you wish to save, right-click to open the context menu, and select `Pieces > Save to Pieces`.

### Copilot Ask

Need the copilot to comment, fix a bug, or add a doc string? Simply go to the command palette and run `Pieces: Ask Copilot`.

### Login/Logout

You can log in and out of your Pieces account using the `Pieces: Login` or `Pieces: Logout` command in your command palette. An output panel is available to check your cloud status and login status.
