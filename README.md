#### Editor Mode

Enter the editor mode with `command/ctrl + e`. You can then modify your asset and save it using `command/ctrl + s`.

#### Copy an Asset

If you're in an asset sheet, you can quickly copy the asset content without selecting it using `command/ctrl + c`.

### Copilot Ask

Need the copilot to comment, fix a bug, or add a doc string? Simply go to the command palette and run `Pieces: Ask Copilot`.
